The objective is to survive while keeping nutrients (calories, proteins, etc.) within defined ranges.

To achieve this, players can eat and cook different foods.

To acquire these foods, players must purchase them from a supermarket using money earned through working.

To work, players participate in the game **Stonks**, where they have to answer questions related to nutrition.
